1. In the NavBar, I used Bootstrap to create the navigation bar. It was optional to create the inside content of the navbar that's why I haven't created them.
2. Same goes with that WhatsApp icon that was also optional so I didn't do it.
3. I have made my website responsive for a max-width of 767px. So it behaves well on desktop mode and when the width is less than or equal to 767px.
   I have applied all the media queries with respect to 767px only.
4. For all the images I have directly copied the svgs.
