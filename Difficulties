The Issue I m facing is to make some parts of my website responsive. Whenver I m tring to check for the responsiveness, my divs size are fixed to 1200px even after 
applying the media queries. So when the size reduces the content size remains fixed. 
I tried using vw, or % in my website but that disturbed the flex properties.
The website is completely working for the laptop screen and I m trying to fix some parts responsiveness so that its completely responsive for all devices.
