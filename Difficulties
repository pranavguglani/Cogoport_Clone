When I m trying to open the website by hoisting on GitHub, it is not showing the footer, but when I m checking for responsiveness on my laptop then in the mobile version it showing.
So, I m trying to fix that and also on my phone that whatsapp(gets started) is not showing properly but when I check on the responsiveness on my laptop it is showing
correctly.
